Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
## Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
## Software – Quartus prime


## Theory
 

## Logic Diagram
Using NOR gates
NOR gate is actually a combination of two logic gates: OR gate followed by NOT gate. So its output is complement of the output of an OR gate. This gate can have minimum two inputs, output is always one. By using only NOR gates, we can realize all logic functions: AND, OR, NOT, Ex-OR, Ex-NOR, NAND. So this gate is also called universal gate. Designing a circuit with NOR gates only uses the same basic techniques as designing a circuit with NAND gates; that is, the application of deMorgan’s theorem. The only difference between NOR gate design and NAND gate design is that the former must eliminate product terms and the later must eliminate sum terms.

F=(((C.B'.A)+(D.C'.A)+(C.B'.A))')'
## Procedure
The input and output variables are allocated with letter symbols. The exact truth table that defines the required relationships between inputs and outputs is derived. The simplified Boolean function is obtained from each output. The logic diagram is drawn.
